    <h3>Test Technician, <i>Allion USA</i> </h3>
    <p>June - August 2018<br>During my time at Allion, I was able to work with 
    pre-released Amazon and Microsoft products and analyzed different access points
    and routers. Here, I was able to work independently and work by myself; however, 
    I was surrounded by mentors who were always able to answer my questions. I had 
    no problem asking questions because I wanted to ensure that I was running the regression
    tests properly for the products.</p>

    <h3>Asset Management and Capital Planning Intern, <i>Oregon Metro</i></h3>
    <p>July - August 2017<br> At Oregon Metro, I saw a small glimpse into what 
    a government agency looks like at all different levels. Here, I worked collaboratively 
    with peers and facility managers about maintanable assets and initiated change 
    in maintenance management systems. I was able to lead one of the weeks at the 
    Portland Expo Center and was in charge of relaying information from the team of
    interns to the facility manager.</p>

    <h3>Busy Smithie | <i>HTML · CSS · JavaScript</i></h3>
    <p>This is a website I created with my friend, Lizette Carpenter, for 
        Smith students to find study spaces off campus. We used HTML and 
        CSS to create this website, in addition to small uses of JavaScript.
        We both went out into Northampton and used different criteria to rate 
        the cafes such as lighting, ambience, and outlets. This was a hands on
        project in terms of both coding and outside work.

    <h3>All About Emily | <i>HTML · CSS · JavaScript</i></h3>
    <p>This is another website I created that implemented more complex use of 
        JavaScript. In this website, I utilized cookies, forms, and Canvas graphics
        to create a more interactive website for the user. I created this website for 
        fun so people could learn a little bit about me through different interactions.

    <h3>GY$T | <i>Python · HTML · CSS</i> <img src="award.svg" alt="Icon" width="25" height="25px"></h3>
    <p>I collaborated with three other students to produce a website that would 
        prioritize students' daily tasks at hand. During this hackathon, I was exposed
        to HTML/CSS and Flask, which I was unfamiliar with. This project won <b><i>Best
        Mobile App.
        </i></b>

    <h3> Use of Data Structures| Java</h3>
    <p>I implemented the <i>Graph</i> interface to create an interactive application 
    of my own design. I then implemented input/output mechanisms and used an algorithm
    to find the shortest path between the first node and the last node.</p>

    <h3>Graph GUI | Java </h3>
    <p>I created a GUI application with a partner, based on a map viewer I had previously created.
        I implemented six buttons so the user could move the map to the left, right, up, and down,
        and also zoom in and out of the map. I achieved this by adding <i>ActionListener</i> and 
        <i>MouseListener</i> methods.
